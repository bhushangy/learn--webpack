<!-- In the absense of a package manager and a bundler, you have to load the dependecies at run time -->
<!-- This approach has its own share of issues -->
<!-- Web vitals like FCP, LCP take a hit if the dependecy is big in size -->
<!-- Even if you are not using all of the functions in the dependency, you still have to load the entire lib -->
<!-- You cannot take advantage of the HTTPS 2.2 parallel connections at a time to the same domain -->
<!-- HTTP/2 allows multiple streams within a single connection, meaning multiple requests and responses can be in-flight simultaneously over one TCP connection. -->
<!-- If you are loading via CDN, then you need to open one TCP connection for each domain which is resource intensive -->
