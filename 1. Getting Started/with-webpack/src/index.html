  <!-- <button onclick="buttonClickHandler()">Click me</button> -->
  <!-- The above buttonClickHandler() will not work because it call comes down to IIFE -->
  <!-- You see in the bundle.js file, all your js code in the index.js file is wrapped within an IIFE -->
  <!-- Now, as we all know, it is not possible to access any variables, functions inside IIFE. But an IIFE can access variables and functions outside of the IIFE -->
  <!-- So buttonClickHandler() is not in the global scope. It is inside IIFE. So you will get ReferenceError when you click the button -->
  <!-- To solve this, add an event listner to the button itself -->
  <!-- So as soon as the bundle is loaded, the IIFE is executed. Since the code inside IIFE can access outside code, it has access to all the DOM apis  -->
  <!-- So event listener is attached to the button element -->
  <button id="button1">Click me</button>
